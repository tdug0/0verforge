# 0verflow

0verflow is a prototype recursive self-improving multi-agent system (RSI). This scaffold provides a minimal, runnable core so you can git clone, make, and run the FastAPI server and RSI loop locally.

Quickstart
---------

1. Clone

   git clone https://github.com/tdug0/0verforge
   cd 0verflow

2. Build & run (local dev)

   make

3. API

   - HTTP: http://localhost:8000/api/v1/status
   - WS:  ws://localhost:8000/ws

Files: core scaffold, simple RSI loop, covenant enforcer, FastAPI app, and a Makefile to create a venv and run.
